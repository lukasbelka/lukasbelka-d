<h1>Hi, I'm Lukas, a German-based Analytics Developer.</h1>
<p>
    Today it's my job to make data human-friendly and usable - I like it! However,
    I was not always diving in data lakes why I would describe myself as kind of hybrid:
    For nearly ten years I worked as a project manager in the financial services industry,
    where I headed the PMO of a large IT transformation project for two years.

<p>
    Back then I realized that dealing with data professionally would enable me to perfectly
    combine domain knowledge with data and IT skills in order to gain insights that matter.
    I have finished my MBA in eBusiness and started programming in Python and JavaScript - a perfect combination!
</p>
<p>
    I believe open data is key to increase transparency and knowledge across all domains. Therefore
    I use data, transform it and share it for free!</p>
