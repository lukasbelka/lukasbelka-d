    <h1>Hi, I'm Lukas, a German-based Analytics Developer.</h1>
    <p>
    Today it's my job to make data human-friendly and usable - I like it! However,
    I was not always wrangling data why I would describe myself as kind of hybrid:
    For nearly ten years I worked as a project manager in the re-insurance industry,
    where I headed the PMO of a large IT transformation project for two years.
        </p>

    Back then I realized that dealing with data professionally would enable me to perfectly
    combine domain knowledge with data and IT skills in order to gain insights that matter.
    I have finished my MBA in eBusiness and started programming in Python and JavaScript - a perfect combination!
