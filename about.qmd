Hi! I'm a German-based Analytics Developer and it's my job to make data
human-friendly and usable - I like it! However, I was not always wrangling
data why I would describe myself as kind of hybrid: For nearly ten years I
worked as a project manager in the primary and reinsurance industry, where I headed the
PMO of a large IT-transformation project for two years.

During that time I received my MBA in eBusiness and got more and more interested
in web technologies and data. Back then I wanted to deal with data professionally
and combine it with domain knowledge, why I started programming in Python
and JavaScript - a never-ending journey!ðŸ˜€

I like the idea of open source and open data, this is why I share things here.
